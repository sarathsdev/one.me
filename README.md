## How it Works ?

Folder Structure
Here is the core folder structure  which flutter provides

```bash
  one.me/
  |- android
  |- build
  |- ios
  |- lib
  |- test
  
```
Here is the folder structure we have been using this project

```bash
  lib/
  |- screens/
  |- utils/
  |- main.dart
  |- ProductModel.dart
  |- generated_plugin_registrant.dart
```
Now, let's dive into the the lib folder which has the main code for the application.
```bash
1- screens - This file contains all the multiple pages of the application.
2- utils - It contains the utilities/common functions of the application.
3- main.dart - This is the starting point of application. All the application level configurations are defined here.
4- ProductModel.dart - It defines what are the items present in a product model.
5- generated_plugin_registrant.dart - It's an auto generated file while setting up firebase for authentication.
```
